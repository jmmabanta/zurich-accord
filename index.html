        "This has been a devastating war that has caused nations across the
        world unimaginable destruction. In the year of our Lord 1918, on the
        eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, the fighting
        was ended. Now the Kaiser has fallen and the fate of the German people
        is in the hands of the Entente. Within the confines of this treaty,
        the terms of territorial and monetary concessions are outlined for the
        new German Republic along with restrictions on military and government
        policy. This treaty aims to create a lasting peace that is not so
        harsh that the German people turn to radicalism for solutions, but not
        one without discipline for the German nation."

          With the ousting of the Kaiser by the German people prior to the armistice which brought the drafting of the
          Zurich Accord, it is within reason to state that there will not be a return to monarchy. Kaiser Whilhelm II
          must give up all claims to any territory within the former German Empire, but his direct descendants and any
          remaining descendants of the House of Hohenzollern may remain as princes, dukes, and any other dynastic title.
          They may not hold any more political power than local politicians, and they may not hold federal offices.
          Within a liberal democracy, there is no need to fear the rise of a new monarchy, especially considering the
          last Kaiser was ousted by the German people, so there is no reason to abolish the House of Hohenzollern as a
          whole. Dynastic members are only restricted from running for federal offices as a failsafe against monarchism.
          Forcing an exile would only turn the House of Hohenzollern into a symbol of martyrdom, and therefore pose a
          threat to a long-lasting peace. The German Empire is, henceforth, formally abolished. The German people and
          German nation shall now take a liberal democracy of their own creation with a constitution approved by at
          least two of the three nations listed here: France, Great Britain, and the United States of America. Once the
          constitution has been approved, no member of the Entente has any right to interfere in German political
          affairs. Ensuring a stable German Republic is absolutely vital to the stability of Europe, so it shall be a
          top priority for this treaty.

          With the Defeat of the Russian Empire on the third of March 1918, the German Empire saw significant
          territorial and political gains. Many nations were released to become puppets of the Kaiser, including
          Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland, with Finland, Ukraine, and Georgia becoming fully independent. With
          the defeat of the German Empire, all territories gained from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk are to be completely
          relinquished by the German Republic, as the power gained from controlling the majority of Eastern Europe would
          be detrimental to the balance of power in Europe and would only serve to counteract efforts to create
          long-lasting peace. Poland shall be granted full political independence, and Southern Silesia shall be
          relinquished as reparations for the German invasion of ethnically Polish land. Polish merchant ships will have
          the right to freely use the port of Danzig without fear of interference to promote economic stimulation in the
          new nation, but the Entente recognizes that there is no right to move the ethnic Germans who live there
          already, so the city shall remain part of the German Republic. There will be a return of the unlawfully
          annexed territory of Alsace-Lorraine back to the French Republic. Any and all colonial possessions of the
          former German Empire shall be ceded to Great Britain and France.

        <p>
          There is not a single European nation that has been untouched by war, but some were more impacted than others.
          Being the primary economic power of the Central Powers, the German Republic will he held economically
          accountable for the destruction of war. With accountability in mind, the German republic will be forced to pay
          75 billion marks in war reparations. 30 billion marks shall go to the French Republic, as the majority of the
          war was fought on French soil with French lives. 20 billion marks shall go to Great Britain, as it was Britain
          exerting itself economically and politically the second most. 10 billion marks shall both go to Belgium due to
          the damages it has suffered as being one of the first contact points in the Western front. 10 billion marks
          shall also be allotted to Italy as a part of the Treaty of London, a pact to switch alliances to the Entente.
          Lastly, the United States of America would receive the remaining 5 billion marks for its late, but effective,
          contributions to the European war effort.<br><br>
          Reparation payments have been significantly reduced compared to the original Treaty of Versailles. This is
          done to allow Germany's economy to thrive under harsh post-war conditions and to preserve the quality of life
          of the German people. Moreover, it allows Germany to pay off its war debts in a more reasonable timeframe.

          The Rhineland and the Ruhr are vital areas for the economy of the German Republic, and it is understood that

          the war reparations assigned. Should reparation payments not be conducted in an orderly timeframe, or if too
          many payments are missed without first consulting the nations being paid, the Entente has a right to occupy
          the Rhineland and Ruhr until the economic output seized is sufficient to make up for missed payments. If
          payments are made in correct quantities regularly, the German Republic is to have full sovereignty over all
          its territories, and the Rhineland and the Ruhr are no exception.

          outlined as one of Woodrow Wilson's fourteen points, Polish ships shall have free access to German waterways
          within the baltic, and Polish merchant ships may be constructed and launched from German-controlled ports

          The final point of the treaty has to deal with the matter of the German armed forces. The arms race of the
          early 20th century proved detrimental to the stability of Europe, so there will be restrictions put on any
          German military activity. The German Republic is to have a standing army of no more than five hundred thousand
          active servicemen with seven-hundred thousand servicemen in reserve. These numbers encompass support personnel
          as well. The air force is to be significantly downgraded, and there are to be no more than two-hundred planes
          in any air force established. The navy may still exist, but there can be no more than fifty ships. Any form of
          a submarine is strictly prohibited, and any aircraft carrier designs must be first approved by Great Britain
          before their construction. No German military forces may be stationed in the Rhineland until the war
          reparations outlined in the Economy section of the treaty have been paid off in full to prevent any military
          resistance to debt collection. There may be no conscription of troops unless in a defensive war. It is
          understood that an overly-large German army poses a threat to European stability, but there is an emerging
          threat in Communist Russia and their expansionist ideological principles. Combating and containing the
          communist threat could end up being vital to the overall stability of Europe, therefore a somewhat strong
          German military is a necessity.
