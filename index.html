        "This has been a devastating war that has caused nations across the
        world unimaginable destruction. In the year of our Lord 1918, on the
        eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, the fighting
        was ended. Now the Kaiser has fallen and the fate of the German people
        is in the hands of the Entente. Within the confines of this treaty,
        the terms of territorial and monetary concessions are outlined for the
        new German Republic along with restrictions on military and government
        policy. This treaty aims to create a lasting peace that is not so
        harsh that the German people turn to radicalism for solutions, but not
        one without discipline for the German nation."

        I. Implementation of a Liberal Democracy
      </h1>
      <div class="info" data-aos="zoom-in-down">
        <p>
          With the ousting of the Kaiser by the German people prior to the
          armistice which brought the drafting of the Treaty of Zurich, it is
          within reason to state that there will not be a return to monarchy.
          Kaiser Whilhelm II must give up all claims to any territory within
          the former German Empire, but his direct descendants and any
          remaining descendants of the House of Hohenzollern may remain as
          princes, dukes, and any other dynastic title. They may not hold any
          more political power than local politicians, and they may not hold
          federal offices. Within a liberal democracy, there is no need to
          fear the rise of a new monarchy, especially considering the last
          Kaiser was ousted by the German people, so there is no reason to
          abolish the House of Hohenzollern as a whole. Dynastic members are
          only restricted from running for federal offices as a failsafe
          against monarchism. Forcing an exile would only turn the House of
          Hohenzollern into a symbol of martyrdom, and therefore pose a threat
          to a long-lasting peace. The German Empire is, henceforth, formally
          abolished. The German people and German nation shall now take a
          liberal democracy of their own creation with a constitution approved
          by at least two of the three nations listed here: France, Great
          Britain, and the United States of America. Once the constitution has
          been approved, no member of the Entente has any right to interfere
          in German political affairs. Ensuring a stable German Republic is
          absolutely vital to the stability of Europe, so it shall be a top
          priority for this treaty.

        II. War Reparations
      </h1>

        <p>
          There is not a single European nation that has been untouched by
          war, but some were more impacted than others. Being the primary
          economic power of the Central Powers, the German Republic will he
          held economically accountable for the destruction of war. With the
          accountability in mind, the German republic will be forced to pay 75
          billion marks in war reparations. 30 billion marks shall go to the
          French Republic, as the majority of the war was fought on French
          soil with French lives. 20 billion marks shall go to Great Britain,
          as it was Britain exerting itself economically and politically the
          second most. 10 billion marks shall go to Belgium to pay for the
          damages of the German invasion, ten billion marks shall go to Italy,
          and five billion marks shall go to the United States of America.

        III. The Rhineland and the Ruhr
      </h1>
      <div class="info" data-aos="zoom-in-down">
        <p>
          The Rhineland and the Ruhr are
          vital areas for the economy of the German Republic, and it is understood that without access to these areas in
          their entirety, there is no conceivable way for the German Republic to pay the war reparations assigned.
          Should reparation payments not be conducted in an orderly timeframe, or if too many payments are missed
          without first consulting the nations being paid, the Entente has a right to occupy the Rhineland and Ruhr
          until the economic output seized is sufficient to make up for missed payments. If payments are made in correct
          quantities regularly, the German Republic is to have full sovereignty over all its terrortiesm, and the
          Rhineland and the Ruhr are no exception.

        IV. Polish Sea Access
      </h1>
      <div class="info" data-aos="zoom-in-down">
        <p>
          All ports in Prussia are in cities that have been ethnically German for centuries, and it is understood that
          the tensions that would arise from moving large quantities of ethnic Germans from their homes would be a
          threat to European stability, so there shall be a compromise made. In accordance with the freedom of the seas
          outlined as one of Woodrow Wilson's fourteen points, Polish ships shall have free access to German waterways
          within the baltic, and Polish merchant ships may be constructed and launched from German controlled ports
          within East Prussia. The German Republic must allow Polish shipping throughout East Prussia, and must allow
          open borders into East Prussia with the newly founded Poland.

        V. Military Restrictions
      </h1>
      <div class="info" data-aos="zoom-in-down">
        <p>
          The final point of the treaty has to deal with the matter of the German armed forces. The arms race of the
          early 20th century proved detrimental to the stability of Europe, so there will be restrictions put on any
          Gemram military activity. The German Republic is to have a standing army of no more than five-hundred thousand
          active servicemen with seven-hundred thousand servicemen in reserve. These numbers encompass support personnel
          as well. The air force is to be significantly downgraded, and there is to be no more than two-hundred planes
          in any air force established. The navy may still exist, but there can be no more than fifty ships. Any form of
          submarine is strictly prohibited, and any aircraft carrier designs must be first approved by Great Britain
          before their construction. No German military forces may be stationed in the Rhineland until the war
          reparations outlined in the Economy section of the treaty have been paid off in full as to prevent any
          military resistance to debt collection. There may be no conscription of troops unless in a defensive war. It
          is understood that an overly-large German army poses a threat to European stability, but there is an emerging
          threat in Communist Russia and their expansionist ideological principles. Combating and containing the
          communist threat could end up being vital to the overall stability of Europe, therefore a somewhat strong
          German military is a necessity.
