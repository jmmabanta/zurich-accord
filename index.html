        "This has been a devastating war that has caused nations across the
        world unimaginable destruction. In the year of our Lord 1918, on the
        eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, the fighting
        was ended. Now the Kaiser has fallen and the fate of the German people
        is in the hands of the Entente. Within the confines of this treaty,
        the terms of territorial and monetary concessions are outlined for the
        new German Republic along with restrictions on military and government
        policy. This treaty aims to create a lasting peace that is not so
        harsh that the German people turn to radicalism for solutions, but not
        one without discipline for the German nation."

        With the ousting of the Kaiser by the German people prior to the armistice which brought the drafting of the
        Zurich Accord, it is within reason to state that there will not be a return to monarchy. Kaiser Whilhelm II must
        give up all claims to any territory within the former German Empire, but his direct descendants and any
        remaining descendants of the House of Hohenzollern may remain as princes, dukes, and any other dynastic title.
        They may not hold any more political power than local politicians, and they may not hold federal offices. Within
        a liberal democracy, there is no need to fear the rise of a new monarchy, especially considering the last Kaiser
        was ousted by the German people, so there is no reason to abolish the House of Hohenzollern as a whole. Dynastic
        members are only restricted from running for federal offices as a failsafe against monarchism. Forcing an exile
        would only turn the House of Hohenzollern into a symbol of martyrdom, and therefore pose a threat to a
        long-lasting peace. The German Empire is, henceforth, formally abolished. The German people and German nation
        shall now take a liberal democracy of their own creation with a constitution approved by at least two of the
        three nations listed here: France, Great Britain, and the United States of America. Once the constitution has
        been approved, no member of the Entente has any right to interfere in German political affairs. Ensuring a
        stable German Republic is absolutely vital to the stability of Europe, so it shall be a top priority for this
        treaty.

          With the Defeat of the Russian Empire on the third of March 1918, the German Empire saw significant
          territorial and political gains. Many nations were released to become puppets of the Kaiser, including
          Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland, with Finland, Ukraine, and Georgia becoming fully independent. With
          the defeat of the German Empire, all territories gained from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk are to be completely
          relinquished by the German Republic, as the power gained from controlling the majority of Eastern Europe would
          be detrimental to the balance of power in Europe and would only serve to counteract efforts to create
          long-lasting peace. Poland shall be granted full political independence, and Southern Silesia shall be
          relinquished as reparations for the German invasion of ethnically Polish land. Polish merchant ships will have
          the right to freely use the port of Danzig without fear of interference to promote economic stimulation in the
          new nation, but the Entente recognizes that there is no right to move the ethnic Germans who live there
          already, so the city shall remain part of the German Republic. There will be a return of the unlawfully
          annexed territory of Alsace-Lorraine back to the French Republic. Any and all colonial possessions of the
          former German Empire shall be ceded to Great Britain and France.

        <p>
          There is not a single European nation that has been untouched by war, but some were more impacted than others.
          Being the primary economic power of the Central Powers, the German Republic will he held economically
          accountable for the destruction of war. With accountability in mind, the German republic will be forced to pay
          75 billion marks in war reparations. 30 billion marks shall go to the French Republic, as the majority of the
          war was fought on French soil with French lives. 20 billion marks shall go to Great Britain, as it was Britain
          exerting itself economically and politically the second most. 10 billion marks shall both go to Belgium due to
          the damages it has suffered as being one of the first contact points in the Western front. 10 billion marks
          shall also be allotted to Italy as a part of the Treaty of London, a pact to switch alliances to the Entente.
          Lastly, the United States of America would receive the remaining 5 billion marks for its late, but effective,
          contributions to the European war effort.<br><br>
          Reparation payments have been significantly reduced compared to the original Treaty of Versailles. This is
          done to allow Germany's economy to thrive under harsh post-war conditions and to preserve the quality of life
          of the German people. Moreover, it allows Germany to pay off its war debts in a more reasonable timeframe.

      <div class="info" data-aos="zoom-in-down">
        <p>
          The final point of the treaty has to deal with the matter of the German armed forces. The arms race of the
          early 20th century proved detrimental to the stability of Europe, so there will be restrictions put on any
          German military activity. The German Republic is to have a standing army of no more than five hundred thousand
          active servicemen with seven-hundred thousand servicemen in reserve. These numbers encompass support personnel
          as well. The air force is to be significantly downgraded, and there are to be no more than two-hundred planes
          in any air force established. The navy may still exist, but there can be no more than fifty ships. Any form of
          a submarine is strictly prohibited, and any aircraft carrier designs must be first approved by Great Britain
          before their construction. No German military forces may be stationed in the Rhineland until the war
          reparations outlined in the Economy section of the treaty have been paid off in full to prevent any military
          resistance to debt collection. There may be no conscription of troops unless in a defensive war. It is
          understood that an overly-large German army poses a threat to European stability, but there is an emerging
          threat in Communist Russia and their expansionist ideological principles. Combating and containing the
          communist threat could end up being vital to the overall stability of Europe, therefore a somewhat strong
          German military is a necessity. Of course, the production and possession of chemical weapons would be
          absolutely forbidden due to its unethical nature as a weapon of mass destruction as evident during its use in
          the Great War.

        Q1. What would be challenges faced by peacemakers striving to create a lasting world peace?
      </h1>
      <div class="info answer" data-aos="fade-right">
        <p>
          The main issue with creating world peace are the conflict of interests between parties and nations. Due to
          differing national interests, history, and political ideals, the idea of ‘world peace’ differs between
          nations. For example, France who has a long history of conflict with Germany sees that world peace can only be
          achieved with, essentially, the complete eradication and humiliation of Germany. As France suffered most of
          the damage caused by the Germans in the Great War, they see Germany as a threat to a lasting world peace. This
          is unlike the viewpoint held by the United States as they see world peace requiring the cooperation between
          all nations. They hold this fairly neutral and ‘pacifist’ approach to world peace not only because of their
          ‘isolation’ from European historical affairs, but the war also provided the US a great economic opportunity
          from all sides. To pursue international cooperation between the European nations is to pursue their national
          economic interests. These conflicts of interests lead to the creation of the Treaty of Versailles, a peace
          agreement that ultimately failed to create long-lasting world peace. It is a treaty that put full blame on
          Germany, with clauses that crippled the German economy and outraged the people. It is a treaty that inspired
          the rise of facism in Germany and Italy, and the coming second global conflict.

        Q2. How believable was the German case that they alone were not to blame for WWI?
      </h1>
      <div class="info answer" data-aos="fade-left">
        <p>
          Germany was one of the key players in starting the Great War, and there is no denying that. However, to assume
          that the German Empire was acting alone in starting the Great war would be foolish. The balance of power in
          Europe had been balancing on a knife's edge many times since the German Empire was formally established, and
          every Eurpoean nation was geared for war. There were so many factors in Europe that lead up to the Great War,
          and it was almost unfeasible that war could be completely prevented. Nationalisitic sentiments had been
          growing in every major power in Europe, and even in some minor powers. Weapons technology saw steady
          advancement since the last large-scale Eurpoean conflict, and nations were overconfident in their military
          strength. Finally, clashing Imperial ambitions would inevitably come to a head. The world was on the path for
          war long before the Germans and Austrians made formal alliances. The death of Archduke Ferdinand was just the
          spark that set off the powder keg of Europe that every nation had a hand in filling. Just about every Eurpoean
          power was, in some capacity, guilty for the Great War. Britain made no secret about its imperial ambitions,
          and was constantly at odds with Germany. France had been an aggressor in the Franco-Prussian war about thirty
          years earlier and was eager for a rematch. Russia was desperate to prove its might after it suffered a
          humiliating loss to Japan in the Russo-Japanise war. Any Eurpoean nation could have started the Great War by
          1914. It just so happened to be one of Germany’s allies that struck the first blow. Another noteworthy element
          of the Great War is that Germany was just supporting its ally. Austria-Hungary may
          not have been justified in attacking Serbia, but the fact is that they were the ones who started Europe down
          the path to war. Germany was just fulfilling their duties as an ally.

        Q3. Do you think Germany was treated fairly by the Treaty of Versailles?
      </h1>
      <div class="info answer" data-aos="fade-right">
        <p>
          The Treaty of Versailles has ultimately failed its goal of maintaining a lasting world peace by its unjust
          treatment of the German nation-state. In its creation, there were no German representatives giving Germany's
          side of the story when it came to the war, no German influence on a treaty that would ultimately affect them.
          Thus,
          each term of the treaty meticulously targeted every facet of the German nation-state under the eyes of its
          enemies. Although it is evident that Germany escalated a conflict, that was otherwise a civil dispute among
          the former Austro-Hungarian empire, the terms that the Treaty of Versailles forced upon Germany were
          unreasonable and ineffective. Although it was Germany that first used immoral weapons, such as the U-Boat and
          mustard gas, it cannot be forgotten that the Allies retaliated with the same deadly force. Millions upon
          millions of
          innocent have died in the war at the hands of both the Central and Allied powers. The Treaty of Versailles’
          ‘war guilt’ clause that it had enforced on Germany unfairly ignores the contributions made by all other
          parties in perpetuating the World War. Massive war reparations thrashed the German economy, making it almost
          impossible for the common people to buy a loaf of bread and even for Germany to pay off its ever-increasing
          war debts. The Zurich Accord aims to relieve Germany of these stresses by loosening up its restrictions and by
          taking into account its effects on the German people and economy.
