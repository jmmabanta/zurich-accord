          "This has been a devastating war that has caused nations across the
          world unimaginable destruction. In the year of our Lord 1918, on the
          eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month, the fighting
          was ended. Now the Kaiser has fallen and the fate of the German people
          is in the hands of the Entente. Within the confines of this treaty,
          the terms of territorial and monetary concessions are outlined for the
          new German Republic along with restrictions on military and government
          policy. This treaty aims to create a lasting peace that is not so
          harsh that the German people turn to radicalism for solutions, but not
          one without discipline for the German nation."

          I. Implementation of a Liberal Democracy
        </h1>

          <p>
            With the ousting of the Kaiser by the German people prior to the
            armistice which brought the drafting of the Treaty of Zurich, it is
            within reason to state that there will not be a return to monarchy.
            Kaiser Whilhelm II must give up all claims to any territory within
            the former German Empire, but his direct descendants and any
            remaining descendants of the House of Hohenzollern may remain as
            princes, dukes, and any other dynastic title. They may not hold any
            more political power than local politicians, and they may not hold
            federal offices. Within a liberal democracy, there is no need to
            fear the rise of a new monarchy, especially considering the last
            Kaiser was ousted by the German people, so there is no reason to
            abolish the House of Hohenzollern as a whole. Dynastic members are
            only restricted from running for federal offices as a failsafe
            against monarchism. Forcing an exile would only turn the House of
            Hohenzollern into a symbol of martyrdom, and therefore pose a threat
            to a long-lasting peace. The German Empire is, henceforth, formally
            abolished. The German people and German nation shall now take a
            liberal democracy of their own creation with a constitution approved
            by at least two of the three nations listed here: France, Great
            Britain, and the United States of America. Once the constitution has
            been approved, no member of the Entente has any right to interfere
            in German political affairs. Ensuring a stable German Republic is
            absolutely vital to the stability of Europe, so it shall be a top
            priority for this treaty.
